A simple tool for collaborative music production on macOS.

## How it works

Point `Trackomatic` at a folder full of audio files (`.aif`, `.wav`, `.mp3` and `.m4a`) 
and it'll play them all together. Great for checking stems, or using with a sync'd drive 
like DropBox or Syncthing for realtime-collaboration.

Drag on a part of a track to leave a comment (don't forget to check your name in the Settings).

## Disclaimer

This is a spare-time project cobbled together over the years, and so undoubtedly contains 
a few üêõ. It is somewhat basic, and has a UI that looks like it's come from the 90s. It 
seems to work on the whole though, so its here in case its of any use to you.

Use at your own risk!

Bug me [@themissingcow@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@themissingcow) with things that
aren't working, ideas or if you want to help make it better!
